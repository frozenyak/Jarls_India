EVTDESCmp.0;Long ago our ancestors arrived in this strange land of six-armed gods to conquer and pillage in the name of Odin. Children nowadays have only heard of Scandinavia in half-forgotten stories. We've adopted so much of the native culture as our own that we must ask ourselves: Are we Norse, or something...different?;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MP_0;If only these Indians knew how to make a good runestone.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MP_0;Tell me more about this mythical realm of Albion.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_MP_0;No ice giants in the jungle, that's for sure.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEmp.1;The New Scandinavia;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmp.1;"It has been century upon century since Great India was last unified under a single banner. Not even Alexander the Great could fully conquer it, but we Northmen have accomplished what he could not. I, [Root.GetTitledFirstName], crown myself Emperor of all India, in the name Odin, in the name of Thor and in the name of Freyr."\n\nWhere they were once mere raiders, the vikings have elevated themselves to the absolute rulers of the faraway subcontinent. One of their own, [Root.GetTitledFirstName], has been declared Emperor of India, a title not truly held since Ashoka the Great. God help us all.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MP_1;For Odin! For Thor! For Freyr!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEmp.2;Strangers in a strange land;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmp.2;The odd religions of these Indians continue to pound against our own like Thor's Hammer, and with every passing year another handful of men forgets his devotion to Thor in favor of Shiva or Buddha. This cannot stand. The most respescted Norse priests have approached you and called for a reorganization of the old custom in India, with a standardized holy book and church.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MP_2;May our faith become stronger than Yggdrasil's mighty roots.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MP_2;Never! The old ways are best!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEmp.3;The Lodbroks;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmp.3;"Just as Old Hairy-Breeches was the scourge of Christians, so shall we be the scourge of the Indians. The march will be long, the trials fierce, but the glory shall be everlasting in Valhalla! Ready the longboats!"\n\nThe drums of war continue to beat in the faraway land of India, where the Norse lords are fighting a losing battle. The Lodbroks, named after the greatest viking to ever live, have formed to reinforce the sons and daughters of Odin in the Far East.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MP_3;We shall never surrender!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MP_3;Bah! The bickering of heathens does not concern me.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEmp.5;The Sack of Mecca;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmp.5;Your raiders have captured Mecca, and you quickly go to work seizing anything of importance from the great holy city. Your men take books, gold, prisoners, and even pieces of the city itself as souvenirs, torching the rest. Flames and smoke dance around the angular black edges of the Kaaba as you return to your longboat.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MP_5;Odin has blessed this journey.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEmp.6;The Wanderers;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmp.6;Boldened by the news of Norse conquests in the Far East, a loose collection of vikings have banded together and begun the long march to India. They call themselves The Wanderers, and are more than ready to fight for anyone who can promise them enough coin and glory.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MP_6;I wish them luck.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MP_6;You mean to tell me those blasted pirates are moving? Excellent!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEmp.7;A whole new world;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmp.7;News from the south! Tjudmund Aleson, a banished son looking for his own claim to renown, set forth a large expedition in attempt to find land to claim as his own. He navigated around the great island chain to the east, then south. Just as they were about to turn around, one of she ships spotted what appeared to be a huge island.\n\nHis supplies were too exhausted to make anything more than a quick expedition, but initial forays revealed that the land is dominated by a large desert beyond the shores. Even more amazing is that the land is already inhabited by other people! For now, Tjudmund has returned, swearing an oath that he will eventually explore his discovery in full.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MP_7;Just how big is this world?;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEmp.8;Settlers reach Dryland;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmp.8;After several more expeditions, explorers have come to the conclusion that this new land is either the largest island in the world, or a new continent altogether. Tjudmund Aleson has started a small settlement on the northern coast of this new land, and so far has only had minor skirmishes with the natives.\n\n He calls this new place Dryland, possibly to lure Norsemen who are tired of India's sweltering jungles.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MP_8;Dryland, hm?;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEmp.9;Discovery of New Norway;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmp.9;Toki Tjudmundson, great-grandson of the great explorer Tjudmund Aleson, has discovered land to the far east of Dryland! Nobody knows what possessed him to sail out into the open ocean, but there he discovered two big islands, and dubbed them collectively as New Norway.\n\nThe story of his exploration boggles the mind. He claims to have found insects as heavy as a man's fist, tiny flightless birds, and even eagles that equal a man in size and pick can him off the ground with ease. These accounts would normally be dismissed as pure fiction if his crew handn't captured one of the great eagles and brought it back as proof.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MP_9;A tale for the ages!;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEmp.10;The Great Southern Land;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmp.10;Mathematicians and philosophers the world over have always speculated that there must be some mysterious continent to the south, and now they have been proven correct. An exiled Norseman all the way from Denmark known only as Olaf the Black arrived in India several years ago, and managed to scrounge up enough resources for an expedition. Sailing straight south, he and his crew spotted several island before finally catching sight of the frozen shores of the Great Southern Land.\n\nFrom Olaf's accounts, the unknown land is almost completely encased in ice, yet life still thrives there, as penguins and seals can be found up and down the coast. Even the white-eyed whales congregate there in high numbers.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MP_10;I always knew there was something down there.;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEmp.11;Farewell to Thee;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmp.11;Not content with just finding the frozen southern continent, Olaf the Black staged a second expedition based out of Dryland, going out farther than any Norse explorer before him. Entire months were spent in the great eastern sea, and many of his crew died of disease and hunger, but they finally made landfall in a strange land dotted with volcanoes, lush jungles and odd natives. Fortunately, the meeting with the locals was peaceful, and Olaf retuned with a shipload of gifts.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MP_11;Good for him.;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_TOG_67001;[From.GetTitledFirstName] the Buddhist is dragged out of the dungeon. As the guards prepare [From.GetHerHim] for the sacrifice under the tree, the prisoner looks dead ahead, whispering something about three jewels.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOG_67001;What's wrong? Didn't Buddha like trees?;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TOG_67001;Meh. Not today.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_67002;[From.GetTitledFirstName] offers no resistence as the guards pull them out of your dungeons. You begin to believe the Jain will say nothing at all until the noose is finally tightened around their neck and they quietly ask you to not do this, for your own soul's sake.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_TOG_67003;Your prisonor is slowly escorted out of the dungeons, prodded all the way by your men's spears. The rope is readied and suddenly [From.GetTitledFirstName] begins to cry out to several of his gods, tears streaming down their face.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_TOG_67003;Wait. Stay the sacrifice for now.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_67004;A Buddhist is brought up for sacrifice. [From.GetSheHe] doesn't say much, but the terror can plainly be seen in [From.GetHerHis] eyes as their recitations of the Eightfold Path are cut short by the tightening of the noose.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_67005;Your liege commands that a Jain, [From.GetTitledFirstName], be brought forth from the dungoens.

EVTDESC_TOG_67006;[From.GetTitledFirstName], a Hindu that had been languishing in your lord's dungeon, is pulled out of the [From.GetHerHis] cell and under the sacrificial tree.

EVTDESC_TOG_3321;As your men burn the settlement, one of your men comes up to you holding a bundle of scrolls under his arm. He hands them to you, explaining that a Buddhist monk died trying to protect them. They must be valuable.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOG_3321;Well, it's not runes, but it'll do.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_3322;One of your men brings back a strange machine. After closer inspection, you find it has a trigger and somehow fires steel-tipped arrows via a pulley mechanism.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOG_3322;What a wonderful contraption!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_3323;By chance, you find an old Roman argenteus lying on the ground. No sooner do you pick it up than you spot a small sack of gold.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_TOG_3325;Your men have looted a local temple, and come back carrying a massive, gold-bound chest. You instruct them to open it, and inside you find an expertly-crafted sword, covered in Norse-like runes with the Hindu symbol for good luck in the center of the blade. You pick it up, swinging it about a few times to hear its song as it cuts the wind. This must be one of the finest swords ever created.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOG_3325;I shall call it...Thurmuth.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_3326;As you walk among the dead enemy soldiers, you spot a blade that catches your fancy. Picking it up, you notice that it is brilliantly embedded with jewels and gold, and heavier than your normal old battle-axe. You decide to make it your new weapon.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOG_3326;I've got a curved sword. Curved. Sword.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_3327;One of your soldiers finds a strange trinket in the looted holdings. From what you can tell, someone made a helmet and attached horns to it, perhaps as a joke. You put it on to the riotious laughter of your men, only to discover you can't remove it due to some otherwordly urge.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOG_3327;I...I must wear this...;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_3328;One of your men returns with something wrapped in colorful cloth. He hands it over and you tear the binding away to find a large sword with an ivory handle and sheath, inlaid with symbols of battle and conquest.

EVTOPTA_TOG_3328;It's beautiful.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_3329;Several of your men come back carrying a large golden statue of the Indian god Shiva. They set it at your feet, asking what to do with it.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_TOG_3330;The holding you looted contained a rather large archive of scrolls and books. Most of it was junk, but you did happen to find a massive tome with a brillaint trimmings. You open it it up, and instantly recognize that it is a very old Quran, the Muslim holy book.;;;;;;;;;x
