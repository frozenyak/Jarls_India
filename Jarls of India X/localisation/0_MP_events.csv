EVTDESCmp.0;Long ago our ancestors arrived in this strange land of six-armed gods to conquer and pillage in the name of Odin. Children nowadays have only heard of Scandinavia in half-forgotten stories. We've adopted so much of the native culture as our own that we must ask ourselves: Are we Norse, or something...different?;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MP_0;If only these Indians knew how to make a good runestone.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MP_0;Tell me more about this mythical realm of Albion.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_MP_0;No ice giants in the jungle, that's for sure.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEmp.1;The New Scandinavia;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmp.1;"It has been century upon century since Great India was last unified under a single banner. Not even Alexander the Great could fully conquer it, but we Northmen have accomplished what he could not. I, [Root.GetTitledFirstName], crown myself Emperor of all India, in the name Odin, in the name of Thor and in the name of Freyr."\n\nWhere they were once mere raiders, the vikings have elevated themselves to the absolute rulers of the faraway subcontinent. One of their own, [Root.GetTitledFirstName], has been declared Emperor of India, a title not truly held since Ashoka the Great. God help us all.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MP_1;For Odin! For Thor! For Freyr!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEmp.2;Strangers in a strange land;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmp.2;The odd religions of these Indians continue to pound against our own like Thor's Hammer, and with every passing year another handful of men forgets his devotion to Thor in favor of Shiva or Buddha. This cannot stand. The most respescted Norse priests have approached you and called for a reorganization of the old custom in India, with a standardized holy book and church.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MP_2;May our faith become stronger than Yggdrasil's mighty roots.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MP_2;Never! The old ways are best!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEmp.3;The Lodbroks;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmp.3;"Just as Old Hairy-Breeches was the scourge of Christians, so shall we be the scourge of the Indians. The march will be long, the trials fierce, but the glory shall be everlasting in Valhalla! Ready the longboats!"\n\nThe drums of war continue to beat in the faraway land of India, where the Norse lords are fighting a losing battle. The Lodbroks, named after the greatest viking to ever live, have formed to reinforce the sons and daughters of Odin in the Far East.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MP_3;We shall never surrender!;;;;;;;;;x

There was no river in all of India [Root.GetSheHe] could not conquer and no city [Root.GetSheHe] could not take. Truly there is none more worthy of entering Valhalla.\n\nYou leave the stone, content in the knowledge that many centuries from now, when its paint has long since faded, scholars will be studying these rune carvings in an effort to glean the wisdom of their words.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_67001;[From.GetTitledFirstName] the Buddhist is dragged out of the dungeon. As the guards prepare [From.GetHerHim] for the sacrifice under the tree, the prisoner looks dead ahead, whispering something about three jewels.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_TOG_67002;[From.GetTitledFirstName] offers no resistence as the guards pull them out of your dungeons. You begin to believe the Jain will say nothing at all until the noose is finally tightened around their neck and they quietly ask you to not do this, for your own soul's sake.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_TOG_67003;Wait. Stay the sacrifice for now.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_67004;A Buddhist is brought up for sacrifice. [From.GetSheHe] doesn't say much, but the terror can plainly be seen in [From.GetHerHis] eyes as their recitations of the Eightfold Path are cut short by the tightening of the noose.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_67005;Your liege commands that a Jain, [From.GetTitledFirstName], be brought forth from the dungoens. As the prisoner is brought out, [FromFrom.GetSheHe] tells the gathered crowd of the horrendous karmic repercussions from this "evil" act. His pleas are met with mocking laughter.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_67006;[From.GetTitledFirstName], a Hindu that had been languishing in your lord's dungeon, is pulled out of the [From.GetHerHis] cell and under the sacrificial tree.
